# Pokedex App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Technology stack
* App was created with React,
* Data about pokemons is read using [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/),
* Fetching it is done using [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios),
* Styling is done using SCSS

## Functionalities
* Listing data from the PokeAPI as nice looking tiles
* Loading more pokemons into the screen / Reducing the amount of listed pokemons to 20 with buttons below the tiles
* Filtering shown pokemons by their names (using searchbar) or by their types (using the checkbox section)
* Clicking a tile results in showing more information about a pokemon
